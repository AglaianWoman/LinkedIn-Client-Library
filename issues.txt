KNOWN ISSUES:

###############

1.  When using the Network Updates API, searching for more 
than one type of status update (i.e. types=['STAT', 'PRFU']) 
will return a syntax error from the LinkedIn server

2.  Field selectors and integer URL arguments don't seem to mix.  
Doing something like (count=0, selectors=['first-name', 'last-name']) 
will return an error from the LinkedIn server stating that 
the count parameter couldn't be parsed as an integer.

###############

RELATIVELY UNTESTED:

1.  Search API support - I've been using the keyword searches
in development with no problems, but most of the rest of the
possible paramters are not tested.

2.  Invitation API - kind of hard to send test invitations
without a willing dummy participant, so this untested
